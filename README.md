# Tail Rescue

### This project is based on having a web page that allows the user to enter information regarding a lost or found pet(mostly dogs).
### We are utilizing Google Maps API and Firebase API to store info entered by the user.
### The idea is to have a simple page containing a table displaying the info of lost or found pets within a table. The Google maps would provide a pinpoint location where the pet was lost or found. Firebase will store information entered.
